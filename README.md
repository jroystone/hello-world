Project Submissions for CS50
I am Jennifer Hui Roystone. I arrived on planet Earth December 11, 1976 at Andrews AirForce Base, Maryland, United States.  After childhood, school, and then 24 years working in the professions of retail, non-profit, and corporate, an interest has sparked within me to immerse myself in the never-ending onion that is Computer Science.
Computer Science, I find, is confounding, interesting, creative, and challenging.  I think I may have found my Home :).
